# score-flyio

‼️ In development.

This repo is forked from the <https://github.com/score-spec/score-implementation-sample> template. The intention is for this to be a valid Score implementation that can deploy to Fly.io and use resource provisioning and all the platform specific features provided by Fly. However, since Fly is considerably different to Kubernetes or Docker Compose, certain Score features will not be available and will be rejected if used in workloads.

This is a rewrite of <https://github.com/astromechza/score-flyio-archived> since the Score spec has moved on and our understanding of resource provisioning and Score feature compatibility is more complete now.
